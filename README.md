# Meh - I created because I was bored.

![Meh Announcement](https://github.com/rajhraval/Meh/assets/35184001/b44122ff-eff4-4cfb-a967-7063a04b2de4)

## What is this?
It's a fun app that suggests you to do something if you are feeling Meh (ie: Bored) with the help of the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/documentation).

## What can you do in this?
- Get a random activity 
- Favorite / Unfavorite it
- Share and Download Image 

## Why I made this?
I never got to explore to make a UIKit app directly from scratch
I made for myself just to revise and practice UIKit, as we all know the interviews are to be around asking to do assignnments on using an API to fetch and display data.
I was bored to re do it again and again and again.
I decided to do it just for myself, improvise and adapt new practices which are better for me.
And an honest answer (To get work lol)

## Tech Stack
- UIKit (No SwiftUI!)
- CoreData
- MVVM

## What I explored in this and still exploring?
- Creating Custom UI Components and Animations
- UIButton Configurations
- Combine and Async-Await
- Protocol Oriented Programming Practices
- Still Exploring

## Contributing
- I am still working to some more improvements for it.
- So if you find something that can be improved or a bug, raise an issue.

Happy Learning :)
